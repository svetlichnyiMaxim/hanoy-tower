This project provides a fast recursive way of finding an optimal solution to popular variants (any number of disks and
rods) of the famous **[tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)**

All project is represented with

# **Position class**

which

## exposes methods

- `toString()`
- `solveRecursivelyWithTimeMeasurement()`
- `solveRecursively()`
- `solveAtDepth()`

# **Line class**

which

## exposes variables

- `hash`

## exposes methods

- `size()`
- `pop()`
- `push()`
- `empty()`
- `peek()`
- `toString()`
- `copy()`

# **occurredPositions value**

which exposes past move generation results
